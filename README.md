# the-farm-2
A Minecraft modpack based around farming (crops).

This is a copy and paste of the Curseforge description. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/the-farm-2 for the modpack on Curseforge.

This modpack is running on the latest version of Fabric at all times (provided you update the modpack's mods and modloader version). It is running on 1.20.1 Minecraft Java edition, the main version for modding. Please make sure you're always updating all of the mods and the Fabric version!

If you are an influencer planning to play this modpack, you MUST give credit in the form of a link. Also, I recommend you actually TELL ME (via a comment) to get your video on the front page of this modpack.

The Farm 2 is based around, you guessed it: Farming! I am obsessed with farming, myself, but not your elegant redstone farms.. Crop farming! I recommend you don't go on an automation arc for immersion, but you still have Create in the modpack, just in case it's one of those "5 am cant be botherd to type correctly or get out a hoe"!
